This program is able to seggregate regions in Europe in different K groups, by means of performing a K-Means Spherical Clustering. The original program's code can be found in the Colab notebook in this repository.

An app will be deployed soon to gather a user's selection of regions and number of groups (K) on which to perform the clustering. Stay posted!
