This program is able to seggregate regions in Europe in different K groups, by means of performing a **K-Means Spherical Clustering**. The original program's code can be found in the Colab notebook in this repository. An 8-means cluster visual map is provided in the notebook as illustration.

An app will be deployed soon to gather a user's selection of European regions and number of groups (K) on which to perform the a K-Means Spherical Clustering. As a result, a visual map will be returned to detect groups of locations with the most similar characteristics, potentially unveiling interesting relationships in the European territory. 

**Stay posted!**
